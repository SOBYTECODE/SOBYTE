WZONIC is a programmable bridge that connects Bitcoin and Solana.

It transforms Bitcoin from a “store-of-value” logic into a “generative” one, granting it renewed intelligence and liquidity within Solana’s high-speed environment.

Through a trustless cross-chain architecture, WZONIC enables BTC to move freely within the programmable layer, no longer as a static asset held passively but as an active entity participating in trading, governance, liquidity, and automation.

The core of WZONIC lies in redefining cross-chain relationships, allowing value not just to migrate but to transform.

Each bridge operation serves as a “translation” between Bitcoin and Solana, converting the non-programmable logic of value into composable intelligent logic.

This bridge connects not only two chains but also two execution paradigms, reviving Bitcoin’s stability within Solana’s programmable layer.
