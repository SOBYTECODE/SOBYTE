OMNDOX transforms Pumpfun into a multidimensional map of behavior, emotion, and flow.

Instead of viewing transactions as isolated events, it interprets every buy, sell, and creator action as a coordinate within an expanding on-chain space. 

Each address, token, and pulse becomes a node in a living network — a continuously updating structure that mirrors the market’s consciousness in real time.

Built directly on Pumpfun, OMNDOX captures every interaction across the platform and assigns it a spatial signature. 

These signatures form what we call the Market Awareness Field — a verifiable topology of influence, reaction, and sentiment. 

Over time, the field evolves into a dynamic “awareness map” that visualizes how collective behavior flows through the ecosystem.

In this system, the blockchain is no longer a flat ledger — it becomes a dimensional archive of motion and intent.

Every coordinate tells a story: who acted, what moved, when it happened, and how it resonated.

OMNDOX isn’t just data indexing; it’s a framework for seeing the invisible structure behind the meme economy — the geometry of belief, rhythm, and reaction that drives Pumpfun itself.
